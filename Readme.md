## Summary
GLoids is a simulation of boids in openGL. The boilerplate code is from [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter). 

## Getting Started
Note: The getting started guide is pulled from [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter).

GLoids has a single dependency: [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/), which is used to generate platform-specific makefiles or project files. Start by cloning this repository, making sure to pass the `--recursive` flag to grab all the dependencies. If you forgot, then you can `git submodule update --init` instead.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ASchneidman/GLoids
cd GLoids
cd Build
```
